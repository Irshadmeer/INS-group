summary: Highlighting Innovative Solutions for Connected Sky at the 6G Summit by KAUST.
abstract: "Last week, I had the privilege of being an invited speaker at the 6G Summit organized by KAUST in Saudi Arabia. üåç‚ú® I presented our vision and key results from the project 6G-SKY (6G for Connected Sky), addressing the growing demand for reliable communication connectivity for ground and aerial users as the deployment of satellites and high-altitude platforms (HAPs) accelerates. My talk highlighted the project‚Äôs innovative solutions and holistic network architecture, seamlessly integrating aerial and terrestrial elements. Discussions included flexible and adaptive network architectures, machine learning-assisted trajectory and handover management, multi-layer drone-aided NTN task offloading, and ML-based handover management schemes for LEO satellites. Special thanks to Ahmed Eltawil and Muhamed-Slim Alouini for hosting this transformative event. üåê‚úàÔ∏è"

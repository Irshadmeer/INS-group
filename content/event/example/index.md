summary: 6G-SKY Workshop at Lakeside Labs to Finalize Upcoming Project Milestones
abstract: 'On October 29-30, 2024, we gathered at Lakeside Labs in Klagenfurt, Austria, for an in-person workshop to finalize the details of our upcoming project demonstrations and dissemination activities—a significant step as we approach the project’s conclusion. Special thanks to Lakeside Labs and to Christian Raffelsberger and Christian Bettstetter for hosting!

The workshop was further enriched by visits to the drone hall and the 5G playground, adding valuable perspectives to our discussions and planning.'

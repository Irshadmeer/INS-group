As an invited speaker, Cicek Cavdar had the privilege of sharing the vision and key findings from 6G-SKY, a project dedicated to addressing the increasing demand for reliable communication connectivity for ground and aerial users. With the growing deployment of satellites and high-altitude platforms (HAPs), the project is paving the way for innovative solutions that integrate aerial and terrestrial networks.

**Highlights of the Presentation:**
- Flexible and adaptive network architectures combining LEO satellites, HAPs, sidelinks, and direct air-to-ground communications.
- Machine learning-assisted trajectory and handover management for flying vehicles (FVs), ensuring operational efficiency and safety.
- Multi-layer drone-aided NTN task offloading tailored for remote IoT applications.
- ML-based handover management schemes for LEO satellites catering to diverse user classes.

Special thanks to Ahmed Eltawil and Muhamed-Slim Alouini for hosting this inspiring summit and fostering an exchange of transformative ideas. Engaging discussions with brilliant researchers such as Asmaa Abdallah, Ph.D., and Abdulkadir √áelik further enriched the experience.

This event highlighted the dynamic role of the telecommunications community in shaping the future of seamless connectivity in the skies. Gratitude also goes to CELTIC-NEXT EUREKA CLUSTER and Vinnova for their support and funding, which have been instrumental in achieving these advancements.

Let‚Äôs continue striving for excellence and innovation as we redefine the landscape of 6G technology! üåê‚úàÔ∏è

The roll-out of 5G is ramping up in many countries. Although 5G technology is more energy-efficient than legacy networks, increased data volumes lead to higher energy consumption. This rise in industrial and sensitive applications increases resilience requirements, posing a trade-off between resiliency and energy efficiency. Legacy cellular network architecture lacks elasticity, hindering network optimization.

Recent advances in virtualization and cloudification enable cloud-based cell-less networks, allowing dynamic resource reconfiguration. Resilient and energy-efficient networks are possible with adaptive network technologies controlled by a cloud and AI native architecture. The rise of renewable energy resources offers opportunities for energy-efficient data processing.

Key issues addressed by RAI-6Green:

- Proposal of AI-based Network Energy Efficiency and Spectral Efficiency optimization.
- Explore solutions for accelerating computation facilities and green computing.
- Solutions for optimizing network sites' power consumption.
- Risk-sensitive optimization for performance management.
- Smart, autonomous BSs for energy-saving features.
- AI-based Network multi-objective optimization using data.
- Definition of KPIs for robustness and energy efficiency.
- Interconnection of 6G networks, edge data centers, and the smart grid.
- Technical-economic study for AI-based, green deployment of Edge computing.
- Services based on heterogeneous data collection for new business models.

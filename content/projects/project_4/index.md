 The project is about creating a generic connectivity and middle-ware platform including security to support application developers for different segments without having to redo the whole stack. The market uptake of Internet of Things applications can thus be accelerated as developers can focus their efforts towards the application in the vertical segments. The platform will be applied and verified in the transport and health sectors; aircraft (and railway) to deliver mobile broadband services as well as support the management of transportation vehicles through sensor and capillary nets and similar for wearable and body sensors in the health area.
 Partners: Ericsson, KTH, Aalto University, Politecnico Milano, Tampere University of Technology, SICS, Aifloo, Bittium, Klunsys and Safemove.

**Seamless Direct Air to Ground Communications in Europe**

The EIT Digital project ICARO-EU aims to provide gate-to-gate connectivity for aircraft through a high-capacity Direct Air-to-Ground Communications (DA2GC) system integrated with ground cellular networks. This will enable high-speed broadband for all passengers flying in Europe.

Key Points:
- Collaboration between Ericsson, Airbus Group Innovations, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and Create-Net.
- Goal: Seamless broadband services for passengers, addressing limitations of current Wi-Fi access on aircraft.
- Market opportunities for mobile network operators and airlines.
- Proof-of-concept infrastructure set up at Airbus in Munich.

The Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) research area focuses on the development and integration of communication networks that operate beyond traditional terrestrial boundaries. NTN encompasses various technologies such as satellite communication, High Altitude Platforms (HAPs), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The primary goal is to extend connectivity to remote and hard-to-reach areas, improve coverage, and support emerging applications such as Internet of Things (IoT), disaster response, and global communication. NTN research aims to enhance network performance, reliability, and efficiency in non-terrestrial environments, paving the way for a more connected and accessible world.
In this area we have following sub areas

1. 6G for Connected Sky:
   - Integration of LEO Satellites: Incorporating low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites into the network architecture to provide seamless connectivity for both ground and aerial users, leveraging their ability to offer low latency and high-speed data transmission.
   - Optimization for HAPs: Developing communication protocols and technologies tailored for high altitude platforms (HAPs) to ensure reliable and stable connectivity, enabling their integration into the network ecosystem for enhanced coverage and capacity.
   - Adaptation for UAVs and Flying Taxis: Designing communication systems capable of supporting the unique requirements of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and flying taxis, such as high mobility, varying altitudes, and dynamic flight paths, to facilitate safe and efficient operation in the sky.

2. Inside Aircraft Communication:
   - mmWave communication for delivering data inside the Aeroplane

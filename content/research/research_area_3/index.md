The Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) research area focuses on the development and integration of communication networks that operate beyond traditional terrestrial boundaries. NTN encompasses various technologies such as satellite communication, High Altitude Platforms (HAPs), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The primary goal is to extend connectivity to remote and hard-to-reach areas, improve coverage, and support emerging applications such as Internet of Things (IoT), disaster response, and global communication. NTN research aims to enhance network performance, reliability, and efficiency in non-terrestrial environments, paving the way for a more connected and accessible world.

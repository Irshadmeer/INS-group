## Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)

### Introduction

ISAC is envisioned to become a key technology in future wireless systems by enabling a large number of high-accuracy sensing applications. It is expected to support various use cases, such as remote healthcare, weather monitoring, asset tracking, gesture recognition, and autonomous vehicles and augmented reality (AR). The main idea is to share infrastructure, resources, and signals between communications and radar sensing to improve spectral efficiency and reduce hardware costs. The ISAC research field focuses on addressing the challenges arise by the integration of sensing and communication systems. Particularly, we have following sub areas 

- **Resource management** : Proposing resource allocation algorithms to guarantee/optimize both sensing and communication performance under various scenarios 
- **ISAC network design**: Proposing energy-efficient network designs and cloud-native solutions for ISAC in cell-free massive MIMO or distributed MIMO networks. Network design for terrestrial and non-terrestrial (such as UAV) targets
- **Developing radar sensing techniques**: Developing target detectors and detection techniques according to the new system models
